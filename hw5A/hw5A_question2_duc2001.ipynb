Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the bacteria while incarcerated. I would say that biology is relatively minor. Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of Health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health statistics from nursing homes and prisons. We found that there is a systemic difference between whites and blacks, said Dr. William W. Stead. About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths. When the primary source was black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the bacteria. Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of Health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health statistics from nursing homes and prisons. By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites to malaria, which is common in Africa. An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not sick. The research found that when living conditions are identical, black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the TB bacteria. I would say that biology is relatively minor. The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until 1984. Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses against TB, because the bacteria has long been common in Europe and parts of Africa north of the Sahara, but is traditionally rare in subSaharan Africa. I would say that biology is relatively minor. I never quite believe anything until somebody replicates it. This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks. At the turn of the century, TB was the nations leading cause of death. While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes. In the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites. In the population at large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as whites.\n",

Mr Neal Knox, sacked from a lobbying position with the NRA in the 1980s but now one of its elected directors, argues that the second amendment is the citizens freedom insurance plan against tyranny. These converts to gun control, however, are a long way from believing that the answer to violent crime lies in more radical action, such as the proposal of Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, for a complete ban on handguns. Voters were swayed by economic considerations and particularly by his firstterm tax increase. The longest journey begins with a single step, Mr Brady said after the bills final passage in the Senate on Wednesday. In Virginia, meanwhile, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democratic candidate for governor, relied in her campaign on gun control and was thrashed by Mr George Allen, her Republican opponent, who did not favour tighter curbs but promised to be tough on criminals by abolishing parole. According to a Gallup poll earlier this year, 57 per cent of people who said they had a gun in their house also favoured stricter laws on the sale of firearms. This is prized by some game hunters for its killing power but detested by emergency room doctors for the damage it inflicts on humans as it mushrooms on impact.

He was taken to a small childrens nursery in the terminal and interrogated, but within minutes the officers had confirmed his identity, Morgan said. According to Searles sworn court deposition, the incident began after he and Woessner, working together as members of an airport antidrug task force, had arrested a passenger as a suspected drug courier. Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests. In his suit, Morgan denies that and contends that he suffered acute physical and emotional distress and embarrassment after the incident and expressed concern about damage to his reputation. Although the officers found no drugs in his possession, Searle said they discovered that the passenger was holding a second plane ticket, and they began looking for his companion. There isnt any possible other conclusion but that the stop was illegal, the judge concluded. Such suspicious behavior include erratic movements, paying for tickets with cash, using an alias, boarding a long flight without luggage and staying briefly in distant cities known to be sources of narcotics.

If it wasnt Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person. Searle then offered to free him if he would forget the matter, according to Morgans lawsuit. If it wasnt Joe, this could have happened to me or my father or to any other black person. I wish that this hadnt happened, Searle said. Its purely based on race or dress, not on whether you are involved in any drug activity, said Gary Trichter, a Houston defense lawyer and former police officer who specializes in such cases. Through Aug. 3 of this year, there have been 121 such arrests. The Morgan case also reflects a growing criticism of police use of the drug courier profile to stem the flow of drugs through airports. But the court said brief detentions must be based on a persons behavior, not just on race or appearance. My argument is that Mr. Morgan overreacted, Lewis said. When Searle noticed a short, muscular black man walk toward them and then turn abruptly toward a bank of telephones, the plainclothes Los Angeles police detective moved in quickly to question him. He said that last year, 254 narcotics arrests were made at Los Angeles International Airport. I wish that this hadnt happened, Searle said.\n",

I want everyone to know that its still there, Samuelson said, tears welling in her eyes. But the story of Mondays 93rd Boston race was Mekonnen and his nation of 42 million, which has reemerged as a force to be reckoned with in marathon running. Now it is Abebe Mekonnen, who was born the year Bikila won the 1964 Olympic Marathon in Tokyo and a nation named its baby boys after its hero. In the postrace news conference, the private Samuelson was as emotional as she has ever been in public. Lisa Weidenbach went flying by me at that point. It was the first time since 1963 that an Ethiopian had run at Boston and Mekonnen, 24, made the most of it.

It is the altitude at which the Ethiopians train that enhances their aerobic capacity. For the first few miles, before the heat, Kristiansen was running at a 217 pace. In two days, Ethiopian runners have won three major marathons. Much of the central part of the country is mountainous, ranging in altitude from 6,000 to 15,000 feet. Still, Kristiansen finished 26th overall, believed to be the highest finish for a woman in this race. Or at least since the last time Ethiopia ventured from its athletic isolation and won three consecutive Olympic gold medals, putting its indelible stamp on the marathon. John Treacy of Ireland, who was third behind Ikangaa here last year, was third again in 21024. Hes a good runner, but he does not have a good finish. Buist, of New Zealand, was second in 22904. The easiest way to be beaten is to drop out of a race. Marguerite Buist went shortly thereafter. It also was the first time Kristiansen had beaten Samuelson in a marathon. I know him very well as a runner, Mekonnen said through an interpreter. I knew that I should stay with him until the last two miles. It appears to be happening again, a generation after Abebe Bikila ran barefoot through the darkened streets of Rome in 1960 to win the first of his two Olympic golds. Had they not boycotted, at least three Ethiopian runners would have been among the favorites in the mens marathon at Seoul.

      "Steroids do not make a runner run faster, Francis explains, but they enable a runner to train harder. Francis offers theories for the positive test result freelancing, sabotage, a screwup by the team doctor but there is no clear answer. About 42 hours after my lifes greatest moment, Francis writes on the first page of his confessional, Speed Trap, his nightmare began. But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught. The early word is that he is still extremely fast, probably one of the fastest men in the world but no longer the fastest. He argues, essentially, that to be a worldclass sprinter, you must use steroids he makes this argument even as Johnson attempts a comeback for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, without them. The book lacks a strong sense of character development. The desire for speed comes with incredible costs, and they are the trap.

SPEED TRAP By Charlie Francis with Jeff Coplon LEADPARA SECTION Arts amp Books SECTION HEADLINE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE TRUTH HEADLINE MEMO Books Bamberger is a Philadelphia Inquirer sportswriter. At the end of Speed Trap, Francis says that steroids cannot be simply banned their use is too prevalent, they can be disguised too easily and they work too well. After a twoyear ban, Johnson is running again without Francis coaching. But the Francis system, like all systems, was not foolproof. And although he spoke of his athletes as if they were family members, too, he made it plain, under oath, that he had given them every steroid combination imaginable, his experiments all carefully calibrated, charted and analyzed. People who want running to be a natural sport are naive. After a twoyear ban, Johnson is running again without Francis coaching. But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught. But I was a sprint coach, and I had a different job, he concludes. It is a formidable challenge to distinguish between nature and artifice, a task I would leave to the philosophers. But, Francis says, there is no logical reason for Johnson to have been caught. Johnson, the worlds fastest man, had tested positive for illegal steroid use. His gold medal was revoked, and his world record was, too. The book lacks a strong sense of character development. Millions of dollars worth of endorsements shriveled up. By encouraging his athletes to use steroids and Francis maintains that they all wanted to do so and knew about steroids before the coach brought the subject up Francis argues that he is simply helping to create a level playing field.\n",

The only way for this oil to ecape out to the sea is by traversing the entire length of Prince William Sound with all its islands, fjords and bays and channels. Theres a high concentration of sea otter, waterfowl, sea birds and pink salmon in that area, said Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for the Interior Department in Washington. Up to 10.7 million gallons of oil was lost on Nov. 1, 1979, when the tanker Burmah Agate collided with another ship in Galveston Bay, Texas. The Coast Guard said the supoenas were routine. You miss the opportunity right at the beginning and youve missed our best opportunity to do something. He said one or more bloodalcohol tests were administered after the grounding, but he said he didnt know know how many people were tested or the results. The Coast Guard said the supoenas were routine. Alyeska spokesman Chuck ODonnel said he was satisfied with his companys actions. Whales, porpoises and seals are also common in Prince William Sound. The initial reponse was inadequate and unacceptable, he said before a news conference Saturday. And during that transit, undoubtedly a large stretch of shoreline will be contaminated, he said. Last year, they were paid about 85 million for their catches, she said. The response to the spill also drew fire from the 12,000member United Fishermen of Alaska. Some 240,000 barrels about 10,080,000 gallons of crude oil from Alaskas North Slope spilled early Friday when the 987foot tanker Exxon Valdez ran hard aground on Bligh Reef, about 25 miles outside Valdez, where it had taken on a total cargo of 1.2 million barrels. Golob said cleanup equipment at the site was grossly inadequate but added that even under ideal circumstances cleanup efforts would not have significantly reduced the spills impact. Whenever you start removing oil from a vessel this size it has to be done in a controlled manner, Wieliczkiewicz said. He also said four members of the Coast Guards Pacific Strike Team from San Francisco, specially trained to deal with pollution and oil spills, arrived Saturday and were helping to rig pumps and assemble equipment needed to transfer oil to the Baton Rouge. However, that oil burned as well as spilled. Some birds have already died, and we are doing our best to try to save the fish by containing the oil to the area where it presently is and by trying to skim it. An animal cleanup station was set up in a building at the community college in Valdez, but volunteers there said they had no animals to work on by midafternoon. The Coast Guard issued a statement late Saturday that McCall has subpoenaed the ships master and two crew members. The subpoenas require them to make themselves available to NTSB investigators arriving Sunday. What we have here is a major environmental catastrophe, said one oil spill expert, Richard Golob of Boston, publisher of Golob Oil Pollution Bulletin. It was unclear if a pilot was aboard the Exxon Valdez when it grounded. McCall said the tests routinely are administered in marine accidents involving federal jurisdiction. And during that transit, undoubtedly a large stretch of shoreline will be contaminated, he said.

      "Many conservatives favour the concept of a strict time limit. If welfare stops, something has to take its place. Such a gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective. This recognised the impossibility of ending welfare overnight and instead set targets for the gradual introduction of workfare. Like Mr Bush, Mr Clinton may have raised expectations that simply cannot be met. In the American mind, welfare has become synonymous with such evils as urban decay, fatherless children, drug abuse and violent crime. Such a gradualist approach would be both humane and cost effective. Next year states will receive federal assistance only if they ensure that at least 15 per cent of the employable welfare case load is working or in training programmes by 1995 the required ratio rises to 20 per cent. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage. These seemingly undemanding targets require a much larger fraction of the welfare population to take jobs at some point during the year. The budget advanced this cause by expanding the earned income tax credit a kind of negative income tax. The objection is not that some families in straitened circumstances need AFDC as a shortterm prop, but that half of those on welfare behave as though they have a meal ticket for life. After two years, welfare cheques would thus be replaced by the offer of a government job at slightly below the private sector minimum wage. In keeping with Franklin Roosevelts dictum that a permanent dole is a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit, the US has never provided permanent welfare support for single, ablebodied adults. Mothers with young children would also be offered state child care facilities. With its economic life support system welfare ripped away, the underclass will shrivel.

One suggestion is that Mr Clinton should follow the example of Roosevelts Works Progress Administration, an agency that at its peak created over 3m public sector jobs.

The U.S. Constitution requires the Census Bureau to count all the \"persons\" in the country every ten years for purposes of reapportionment of seats in the house of representatives. It does not specify citizens. Some representatives feel that illegal aliens, if counted, may give some states like California and Texas and extra seat.

Dymally, DCalif., however, said he is unsure whether the bills backed by Ridge and others are constitutional. Lawmakers clashed Thursday over the question of counting illegal aliens in the 1990 Census, debating whether following the letter of the Constitution results in a system that is unfair to citizens. It was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes. The result, he said, was that Georgia and Indiana lost House seats to New York and California. And Rep. Albert G. Bustamente, DTexas, termed the worry over counting aliens hysterical, pointing out that the movement of Americans into western and southern states has had a much larger effect on representation than the presence of aliens. Every census since the Constitution was adopted has counted all residents of the states, including both legal and illegal aliens, added Rep. Don Edwards, DCalif. The result, he said, was that Georgia and Indiana lost House seats to New York and California. The Census Bureau also opposes the bills, contending that the effort to determine who is an illegal alien could delay and complicate the count and that people would be unlikely to tell the truth anyway. It was never the intent of the framers to include only citizens for apportionment purposes. This is a fairness issue, said Rep. Thomas J.

Only about 500 mature trees were on an acre of hillside here before the fire. These and the rest of the parks thermal features remain unscathed by the fires. This is amazing, says Mr. Despain, reflecting on his count. The mature forest has the least biological diversity of any habitat in the park, Mr. Varley says. Seeds that have been dormant for decades beneath the soil appear to be triggered by the passing fire, he says, and will germinate next spring.

The slowgrowing trees, only seven to 10 inches in diameter, were relatively young by Yellowstone standards. Television pictures of the Yellowstones fires at their height made things look worse than they are. The park service is under unwelcome political pressure to feed the herds if the winter is severe.

The most intense hurricanes, Gray explains, usually form at low latitudes from tropical disturbances moving westward from Africa. But in the 1990s, he warns, U.S. destruction will be at least four to five times more costly than in the 50s and 60s, because of the boom in population and property development along coastal areas.

      "Flooding in the South and the Plains has been as destructive as the tornadoes. The death toll from last weeks flash floods in Shadyside, Ohio, rose to 21 on Monday, making the flood one of the most deadly in recent years. Ostby credited the quicker response to computers that allow meteorologists to see many sources of data, such as satellite readings, more clearly. The tornado was the strongest to hit the United States since 1985. Our longer range computer forecasts are suggestive of that. The culprit in this tornado barrage across the Plains is a persistent West Coast pattern of low pressure in the upper atmosphere that is keeping the jet stream anchored at a southern latitude. This moves the boundary of the jet stream to the north, Ostby said. The tornado was the strongest to hit the United States since 1985. Tornadoes have caused 20 deaths this year, while an average year in the 1980s saw 52 deaths, and in the 1970s nearly 100, Ostby said. The first weekend in June saw the worst outburst of tornadoes since 1974. But a break in the storm pattern may be at hand. The floods destroyed as many as 70 houses and damaged up to 40, officials said. But warning of impending storms is becoming more sophisticated, leading to fewer deaths.

      "A computer study suggests the 1988 drought in the Midwest may have been caused by bands of ocean abnormal temperature near the equator in the Pacific Ocean. While meteorologists often blame such droughts on the jet stream being north of its usual position, this is not the cause. In April-June 1988, there were alternating high and low pressure centers across the northern Western Hemisphere preventing the normal flow of weather systems. Computer modeling suggests that these centers were related to unusual ocean temperature variations observed in the Pacific. If valid, monitoring ocean temperature may provide forewarning of droughts.\n",

Mr. Gray searched back in recent history and found that the Sahel, which includes parts of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Gambia, goes through long periods of alternating dry and wet weather. He found that the Sahel was especially wet from 1870 to 1900 and from 1915 to 1935. Based on the new findings, Mr. Gray predicted earlier this summer that the 1990 tropical storm season would be above average, and so far he seems to be right. Mr. Gray said he believes that in the absence of moisture, these storms quickly dissipate, but that the storms gather strength with additional moisture. The National Hurricane Center said that as of yesterday there have been nine named storms this year, including four hurricanes, a higher rate than normal. Mr. Gray said his research, published in the current issue of Science, suggests that intense Caribbean hurricanes Gilbert, Joan and Hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change.

      "Some members of congress argue that the Second Amendment's \"..right to bear arms\". precludes any legislation designed to control arms. Another view is that the Second Amendment provides a solid basis for effective gun control legislation. Justification for this point of view is based on an interpretation of the Amendment's wording in the light of the situation existing in 1792. For purposes of gun control today, it would mean that Congress require owners to register their firearms with the National Guard. This would provide the necessary information concerning owners as required by the Brady Bill and other gun control legislation.\n",

More evidence of the connection can be found in the Militia Act of 1792. The Constitution nevertheless says nothing about the undeniable right to own a dog. These rights are neither denied nor disparaged by not being raised to the explicit constitutional level. A constitutional amendment calling for the prohibition of standing armies in time of peace was proposed by six state ratifying conventions. Eventually the committees version was narrowly approved. Congress has been dismayingly inconsistent in its voting on guncontrol legislation this year, first passing the Brady Bill, then moving in the opposite direction by defeating a provision to ban certain assault weapons and ammunition. The debate focused exclusively on the conscientious objector provision. There are uncountable numbers of rights not enumerated in the Constitution. What does this mean for the question of gun control today? Eventually the committees version was narrowly approved. Certain explanations were lost or buried in this legislative process that the right to bear arms meant the right to serve in the militia that just about everybody was included in the militia and that the amendment as a whole sought to minimize if not eliminate reliance on a standing army by emphasizing the role of the state militia, which would require that everyone be ready to be called to serve.

The unit has been allowed to continue to operate despite its high shooting rate or, worse still, because of the shootings. Mr. Gates would have been better advised to seek community programs for jobs, education, elimination of prejudice and improvement of neighborhoods. Indeed the Rambolike challenge did not lower violence, and may have increased it. More recently, he described the killer of a policewoman as an El Salvadoran, who shouldnt have been here. Clearly, Daryl Gatess words and actions create doubt about his claim that the Rodney King incident was an aberration. Last year Los Angeles paid 3 million to 52 residents of an apartment complex ransacked by police. Even Mr. Gatess apology to Mr. King sent the wrong message. Presumably, the chief has now received wiser council. Yet, its hard to imagine commanders preaching restraint in light of the chiefs constant belligerent pronouncements. Mr. Gates opposed the Police Corps because its members would not be professionals. Mr. Gatess statement did nothing to lessen the tragedy of the fallen officer, but like his statement about blacks, it gave comfort to bigots within and outside the department. A police chief plays an essential role in setting the climate in which his department operates. Even Mr. Gatess apology to Mr. King sent the wrong message. A few years ago Chief Gates referred to gang members as dirty little cowards, and warned them that there is resounding applause to every fall of the hammer. Or was the chief suggesting that the beating was a warning against further runins with the police? Indeed the Rambolike challenge did not lower violence, and may have increased it.

Yet the presence of such nonprofessionals would discourage the racism and brutality exposed by the Rodney King beating. The brutal beating of Rodney Glen King by Los Angeles policemen offers convincing evidence that a code of silence exists within that department, but it also illustrates a similar reluctance of the nations police chiefs to criticize a fellow chief. Or was the chief suggesting that the beating was a warning against further runins with the police? Blatant racist jokes and comments about the beating on the police communications system make it hard to believe that this was an aberration as Chief Daryl Gates claims.

Yost is scheduled to arrive in Valdez on Tuesday to review the latest plan. Exxon says the center will open Wednesday. Bane said an aerial survey showed an amorphous oil patch 10 miles wide and more than 20 miles long in the Shelikof Strait, which is located along the migration route used by whales. Before the plan was released, Yost said he wanted much more detail than Exxons original cleanup plan, which included nothing on polluted areas outside the sound. Both methods likely will require exemptions from local environmental laws. The animals depend on their thick fur for insulation against the cold water but the oil ruins the insulation effect. We have seen several hundred sea otters swimming in oil. The oil has had an impact on virtually the entire coastline of the park, Bane said. The 4 millionacre park also is a haven for brown bears, a coastal cousin of the grizzly. The gunk and sludge that resists treatment or salvage will be burned or buried, according to the Exxon study.

Gray based his early outlook on the presence of light easterly winds at the equator and the approaching end of El Nino period. It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years, except for the 1985 season, Gray said in a paper presented to the conference. Gray predicted four hurricanes last season, and three actually occurred. He said the drought has robbed storm systems of moisture needed to start their escalation into hurricanes. He issued an early outlook Friday for the 10th annual National Hurricane Conference. Drought in West Africa is responsible for a drop in Atlantic hurricanes in the 1970s and 1980s, Gray said. Gray, who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984, will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late May. In 1984, when there were five hurricanes, Gray had predicted seven. His prediction of four in 1986 was on the money, and he originally predicted eight hurricanes before adjusting that figure to seven, the eventual correct number, in 1985. A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas, but says its impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas. Those years brought just two to five hurricanes each, except for the seven hurricanes spotted in 1985.\n",

The European Community hesitates to recognize Slovenia and Croatia, for whom it brokered a peace plan, for fear of encouraging its own minorities. Slovenia is used to being considered prosperous and Western and is disillusioned at feeling poor and shunned. Slovenia needs to find new markets to replace Yugoslavian markets, which purchased a quarter of Slovenia's goods. Exports need to double to match European standards.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has held up recent events here the Yugoslav army assault on Slovenia and the bitter ethnic clashes between Croats and Serbs as a warning to his land of what can happen when nationalism fractures a country. Nestled between the Alps and the Adriatic, Slovenia became the most prosperous patch of communist Europe. Now, Mr. Skoberne and others worry about an emerging Slovene risk. But as Slovenes measure themselves with Western Europe, it is they who are the poorer cousins.

The Slovenes, from their days in the AustroHungarian empire, have always considered themselves to be Westerners. For the moment, the Slovenes are feeling lonely, unrecognized by the nations of the world. While the European Community is counting on the peace plan it brokered to defuse tensions it calls for a threemonth period of negotiations in Yugoslavia, most governments concede that the countrys breakup is inevitable.

Our worst predictions are coming true, he said. The epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or mad cow disease which has killed more than 100,000 animals in the UK is causing a new wave of public concern. Experiments show that BSE can be transmitted between species, for example from cow to monkey, by injecting or eating large amounts of infected tissue. The prion molecule is folded in a way that makes it extremely stable and therefore difficult to destroy by conventional sterilisation. According to their investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf which would prolong the epidemic is very rare or nonexistent. According to their investigations, maternal transmission from cow to calf which would prolong the epidemic is very rare or nonexistent. Although sheepderived feeds were banned from sale in 1988, farmers apparently continued to use existing stocks for longer than the ministry had expected. One argument put forward by the health department is that CJD has such a long incubation period typically 10 to 20 years that clinical symptoms would not yet have appeared, even if BSE had triggered any cases of CJD. Since the illness of the cows in Templemans herd and the patient occurred within months of each other, the animals and the patient had presumably incubated disease in parallel for some years, the health department said. New cases are still running at almost 1,000 a week and last month a second dairy farmer died of CreutzfeldJacob Disease, a brain disorder similar to BSE. The prion may arise by a genetic mutation spontaneous or inherited in the host animal. Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of their own.

Scientists trying to understand the epidemic face an unusual problem BSE, scrapie and CJD are caused by a bizarre, infectious agent, the prion, which does not follow the normal rules of microbiology. Most independent experts maintain that no human being dairy farmer or beef eater is likely to be exposed to BSE in sufficient quantities to develop brain disease. Unlike viruses and bacteria, prions contain no genetic material of their own. The official view is that the deaths are an unfortunate coincidence, even though it is statistically unlikely that two dairy farmers should contract a disease as rare as CJD. The source of infection was proteinrich cattle feed contaminated with scrapie, a related brain disease of sheep. Or in the case of BSE it may arrive from another animal.\n",

      "The World Health Organization, after the first global study of tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease is now the worlds deadliest infectious disease. The disease kills nearly three million a year, most between the ages of 15 and 59. It is anticipated that the number of deaths will rise sharply, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. The increases already seen and those anticipated are attributed in large measure to the connection between AIDS and tuberculosis. At one time experts thought that tuberculosis was on a path to extinction, and its now epidemic proportion is disheartening.\n",

      "Also, an estimated 1.7 billion individuals worldwide carry the organism but are not infectious to others. However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and compliance is a major problem. Tuberculosis has become the worlds deadliest infectious disease, and the toll could soon rise even more dramatically if controls are not initiated quickly, the World Health Organization said Monday. However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and compliance is a major problem. Effective drugs to combat tuberculosis cost about 30 to 50 per person, given over six months. It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public health officials worried, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said in a statement. The U.N. agency, in its first comprehensive look at global tuberculosis in a decade, said the disease kills nearly 3 million people a year, most of them between the ages of 15 and 59, the segment of the population that is economically most productive. In these individuals, the organism can remain dormant without causing active disease for many years unless the immune system is somehow impaired. WHO attributed the sharp rise in part to the growing AIDS epidemic. You dont have to have a depressed immune system to get tuberculosis. AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the bodys immune system. It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public health officials worried, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said in a statement. These new data have been stunning to everyone, because an awful lot of people had thought that tuberculosis had gone away, said Dr. Barry Bloom, a professor of microbiology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and a consultant to the United Nations. In New York City, which has the highest number of AIDS cases in the nation, the incidence is 36 per 100,000, Bloom said. Many of these people do, in fact, die of AIDS. It is becoming a parallel epidemic, and it is this trend that has public health officials worried, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, said in a statement. Tuberculosis is a highly communicable disease of the lungs and other organs caused by a bacterium transmitted through the air when infected people cough or sneeze. However, the drugs are not always available in developing countries, and compliance is a major problem. There are about 8 million new cases of tuberculosis a year, according to the U.N. agency. But when a case of tuberculosis becomes active, as it can in individuals who carry the organism, that person can also infect numerous others.\n",

Officers Steven Vendt and Humberto Jimenez were called to assist Ruggiero, the complaint said. Gonzalez was taken to St. Johns Regional Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and spent two weeks recovering from his injuries. Luna had asked the city for 50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for humiliation suffered in public. In an incident April 7, Sergio E. Gonzalez, 19, accused Oxnard officers of ordering a police dog to attack him before he was arrested. McCracken said Flores never struggled with the officers until after he was placed in the chokehold. Police arrested Gonzalez on suspicion of disturbing the peace, Brodie said. McCracken said Flores was beaten so severely that he suffered a detached retina and might lose partial sight in one eye. Luna said in an interview that he, his wife and several friends were leaving the restaurant on July 16, 1988, when an Oxnard police car pulled up in front of the group. Luna had asked the city for 50,000 for medical expenses and to compensate for humiliation suffered in public. In a suit filed June 29, Gonzalez said he was standing on Sunkist Circle when the dog attacked him, biting him on the arm and left shoulder. But the district attorneys office declined to file any charges because the police report failed to show that Gonzalez was involved in the altercation, Brodie said. The officer poked him with a baton and questioned him about a car parked nearby, GuzmanFlores said in the suit. Cornett, maintaining that he never struggled with the officer, said he suffered a broken tooth and a cut lip during the beating. Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who allegedly brandished the weapon. Two of the incidents have led to an investigation by the Police Departments internal affairs division. The district attorneys office decided to prosecute Luna, but in September, 1988 before his trial began all charges against him were withdrawn for lack of evidence, Brodie said. Flores was arrested on suspicion of resisting arrest and obstructing an officer. Luna was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct under the influence of drugs. Camarillo said Cornett fit the description of the man who allegedly brandished the weapon.

An investigation revealed that the Fatah Revolutionary Council (FRC) carried out the assassination in coordination with the Jordanian fundamentalist Islamic Mobilization Youth Organization (IMYO).

Confirmed information indicates that in early 1994, IMYO elements held an important meeting in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with officials from the FRC. The plan to assassinate alMaayitah was drafted during these meetings. The information confirms that AbuNidal groups leadership agreed to execute the mission for the aforesaid reasons, because of its commitment to the policy of extremism and rejection that aims at torpedoing the peace process, and because of its ties to Iran within the framework of international terrorism. A few days ago, Palestinian Ahmad Mahmud AbdalKarim, a prominent FRC official, arrived in Lebanon from Finland on the special mission of following up the investigations the Lebanese authorities are conducting with the Palestinians from the AbuNidal group who are accused of the assassination of Jordanian First Secretary Naib alMaayitah in Beirut on 29 January.

The problem has been in deciding which states may count these people as residents. While aliens have been counted in the past, military personnel stationed overseas have not. Undocumented aliens are largely concentrated in the South, West and industrial states like New York, and other states fear a loss of power to those areas if the aliens are counted. Census figures are used to redistribute the 435 House seats among the states every 10 years and to distribute federal aid to local governments. Rep. Tom Ridge, RPa., unsuccessfully sought to attach a ban on counting aliens to an appropriations measure providing 5.8 million to run the State, Justice and Commerce departments next year, including 800 million to take the census.

As recently as June of this year, the Supreme Court again reiterated that the states have reserved to themselves, via the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate elections. This law was found not to be an improper additional qualification because a valid state interest was pursued. Floridas attorney general has asked its state Supreme Court for an advisory opinion on a termlimit initiative that would limit the states members of Congress to eight consecutive years in office. Nor do they limit an incumbent who leaves office for a period of time six years in Washington state from running again. Term limitations do not restrict the right to vote for a candidate because of his or her ideology or party. Nevertheless, the California decision demolished many of the legal arguments made by incumbents. On this basis, term limits merely ensure a fair election system and the republican form of government guaranteed the states under the Constitution. Each candidate would have to answer the question Will you adhere to a year term limit? Each candidate would have to answer the question Will you adhere to a year term limit? In its 1972 decision Bullock v. Carter and again in its 1982 decision Clements v. Fashing, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that a particular candidate has no fundamental right to ballot access or to run for office. They do not prevent anyone from having an opportunity to serve in Congress. Nor do they prevent a House member who has reached a term limit from running for the U.S. Senate or vice versa. But critics of stateimposed term limits on Congress miss the point. Federal courts have upheld many state restrictions on who may qualify for ballot access. In explaining that interest, the court recognized that there must be a substantial regulation of elections by the states if they are to be fair and honest, and if some sort of order is to accompany the democratic process.

He had decided he could not comply with requirements of a consulting job he had accepted from the Agency for International Development, and he was scrambling to come up with a suitable substitute. The concept is similar to the one behind the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh channeling money to the impoverished, principally mothers, without the demands of commercial banks for collateral, so they can improve their families lives. Capitalization for one bank typically will cost a sponsoring agency 5,000. She then contacts others to attend an organizing meeting. Village banks are operating in Mexico, Haiti, Thailand, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia, Peru and El Salvador. And yet within 16 weeks theyre all experts. Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says, John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor. I had my calculator out and I was sketching this thing and I was doing numbers, and I arrived in La Paz with a fullblown concept. The series of loans, starting at 50, is renewable over three years to a ceiling of 300, allowing recipients to reach a level at which they can qualify for commercial credit. And yet within 16 weeks theyre all experts. In some countries, the repayment rate has been 100 percent. Lawrence Yanovitch, small enterprise development program coordinator for Catholic Relief Services in Baltimore, Md., says, John Hatch is close to the voice of the poor. Their vehicle for improvement is the village bank, each comprised of 30 to 50 women who, through loans starting at 50, can earn enough to provide savings and create capital. What he foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics. Overall, the average is 97 percent, says Hatch. Though hes come up with some sophisticated economic tools, hes kept the humanitarianism. The foundation has major proposals pending with the Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation, Citibank and the Chase Manhattan Bank, among others. We want to know who the most powerful woman is in that village. Women who join the bank screen members and elect their leaders from firstmeeting attendees. In some countries, the repayment rate has been 100 percent. What Hatch foresees is a body blow to world poverty through bootstrap economics. And on my second double bourbon at 35,000 feet up flying over the Andes, I have to say it was like this thought just rolled through my body, Hatch recalls.

The reasons for shutting down the engine are not yet clear and are still under investigation, it said. The plane took off at 752 p.m. Sunday. In the United States, NBC News quoted unidentified U.S. government sources as saying the planes flight recorders, which monitor engine performance and the pilots conversations, indicate the crew shut down the wrong engine.

The engines are made jointly by U.S.based GE and a French company, SNECMA. The jet, en route from London to Belfast with 126 people aboard, plunged into an embankment a halfmile short of the runway at East Midlands Airport in central England as it was trying to make an emergency landing Sunday night. The plane took off at 752 p.m. Sunday. The Transport Department said that evidence obtained early in the investigation indicated both of the planes engines might have suffered a related failure and that possibility was still being examined. Error on the Flight Deck, the Today newspaper said. The government also ordered immediate checks of engine monitoring systems on similar aircraft to verify that they correctly indicate right and left, prompting speculation that a malfunctioning alarm system could have misled the flight crew. The engines are made jointly by U.S.based GE and a French company, SNECMA. The Washington Post, quoting unidentified accident investigators, said the crew believed they were making a routine, oneengine emergency landing, and apparently thought they had solved the problem when they shut down an engine. The plane took off at 752 p.m. Sunday. Fatal Error said the Daily Star. But certainly this precautionary measure does not imply there has been any cause identified for the crash. A letter from a GE attorney last year said test records may have been falsified for the fighter plane valves.

IDC, an independent who markets diamonds for four countries, refutes this and argues Botswana doesn't know the real value of its diamonds, which represent half De Beers' profits.

He said Because the major diamond producers freely consent to sell exclusively through one channel, the CSO is able to preserve an orderly market by matching rough diamond sales closely to consumer demand. In addition, Botswana this year faces its first budgetary deficit since 1982 and, according to De Beers calculations, one of its diamond mines Orapa needs investment of USDollars 600m. Argyle, too, wants to stay with the CSO when its contract ends on May 1 but on more favourable terms. It already markets diamonds for producers in Guinea, Guyana, Brazil and the Central African Republic, and is offering to do some marketing for Botswana. He is not a trader, he does not know what the stones are worth in the market. It is not the first time that contract negotiations have gone on past the theoretical deadline. On a political level this would enable the government to answer its critics or its electors with confidence and sure knowledge when questioned about arrangements for the disposal of the countrys mineral assets. Other substantial producers such as the Soviet Union, Angola, Zaire and Australia do not sell all their production to the CSO and therefore have access to independent market information. But the fact that the CSO forms part of an aggressive, profitmotivated public company with a primary responsibility to its shareholders is often lost from view. This profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by Debswana De Beers subsidiary in Botswana to the CSO as a percentage of the CSOs total sales profits, IDC says. Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, chairman of the groups Central Selling Organisation, argues that if Botswana chose not to sell its production exclusively through his organisation, the CSOs ability to regulate the distribution of rough diamonds would be compromised. This profit is disproportionate to the sale of diamonds by Debswana De Beers subsidiary in Botswana to the CSO as a percentage of the CSOs total sales profits, IDC says. According to the CSO, these valuers are fully informed about market conditions and the prices received for Botswana stones. To maintain price stability, the CSO is stockpiling diamonds at great expense, rather than releasing unwanted stones to the market. De Beers insists it remains on cordial terms with Botswana and says the country is still selling its diamonds through the CSO. The CSO has also notched up some recent coups bringing a big part of the Soviet Unions and Angolas rough diamond output back into the cartel or what it calls its single channel marketing arrangements.

Future challenges include nations wanting more control over distribution, cheaper diamonds on the market, and a possible US ban on South African diamond imports.\n",

The republic of Slovenia plans to begin work on a constitution that will give it full sovereignty within a new Yugoslav confederation, the state Tanjug news agency reported Monday.

Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. The Southwood report said it is most unlikely that the disease poses a threat to humans. Mad cow disease has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britains cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months. Irelands Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of BSE hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep byproducts as a protein supplement. The Southwood report said it is most unlikely that the disease poses a threat to humans. It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health, a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture Ministry. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder. The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. I think everyone agrees that the risks are low, says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100 of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. But the report added If our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious. There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as CreutzfeldtJakob disease. The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. I think it is a recognition not just of pressure from farmers but that the public would feel more confident that no BSEinfected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 compensation, said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union.

A problem with term limits is that it creates more lame ducks, who are less responsive to the desires of the electorate. But if the electoral control process is working, so that officeholders conform with the interests of the majority of their constituents, then the electorate rewards its representatives with reelection. This argument is similar to the Galbraithlike view that big corporations with massive advertising budgets can consistently dupe their customers into buying inferior products. The weakening of the seniority system in Congress would, it must be conceded, sacrifice some genuine benefits. It does not seem to matter much it may even be detrimental if the content of a Civil Rights Act actually has something to do with civil rights. A problem with term limits is that it creates more lame ducks, who are less responsive to the desires of the electorate. From the standpoint of balance of power, it would surely be preferable to repeal the 22nd Amendment. To economists, term limits sound like minimum wages, rent controls and similar interferences with free markets. As an example, the voters of Washington state recently rejected a proposal that would have limited the seniority of their congressional representatives relative to those of other states. Of course, since the passage of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, there is a twoterm limit on the presidency, and 29 of the 50 states have some kind of term limit on the governor. Seven of these limits have been introduced since 1960. It is unrealistic as well as undesirable to try to remove completely the operation of a seniority system in any legislature. Many commentators bemoan the high tendency for incumbents to be reelected. If we ever see a 50 reelection rate, then there really would be reason to worry. The weakening of the seniority system in Congress would, it must be conceded, sacrifice some genuine benefits.

From the standpoint of balance of power, it would surely be preferable to repeal the 22nd Amendment. If we ever see a 50 reelection rate, then there really would be reason to worry. Seven of these limits have been introduced since 1960. The counterargument is that experience is an important characteristic for legislators. Greater experience may justify positions of more authority, and, the rewards from seniority give Congress an efficient method to motivate good behavior from junior members.

The decision by Taney was eventually carried over into the context of the Second Amendment due to the racial paranoia about black men with guns. This paranoia resulted in restrictions being placed on gun ownership.\n",

Among the culprits are carbon monoxide (impairs judgement), microscopic carbon particles (lodges in the lungs), aldehydes (irritates air passages), and hydrocarbon-based substances (gene damage and cancer). Wildfire smoke also may accelerate aging, prompt fatal heart attacks, and trigger respiratory diseases (bronchitis or asthma). Overly heavy gear and inadequate filters are major problems. Developing protection has received little attention. Researchers have asked Congress to fund a $13.4 million study on health threat and respiratory protection.\n",

Kucan all but ruled out the chances of negotiating the return of Slovenia to Yugoslavia. The Tanjug news agency reported that 200,000 Serbs were expected to join a territorial militia in Serbia, the biggest Yugoslav republic, which opposes independence for Slovenia and Croatia, and Negovanovic said Croatia had ordered a mobilization of its police reserves. Such a meeting might have resolved the leadership vacuum in the federal government. I cannot foresee Slovenia becoming a part of Yugoslavia in a democratic way. The Slovenian government charged the army with repeated breaches of the ceasefire and demanded the surrender of army units and installations that Slovenian forces had surrounded and cut off since the fighting began Thursday.

The peace package was assembled by federal Prime Minister Ante Markovic, brokered by an emergency mission of the European Community and accepted by the leaders of Slovenia and Croatia, as well as Serbia. His statement, just a day after both sides agreed to a ceasefire, indicated that a plan to resolve the states ethnic, political and economic disputes had gone off the rails less than 18 hours after it was accepted. The Slovenian defense forces continued efforts to recapture border posts and said they had several under their control.

      "Central American and Caribbean governments await a US statement on Caribbean basin market protection in the US and Canada, promised by President Clinton in talks last year. Regional leaders fear Mexico could capture Caribbean-developed markets and investments could be diverted to Mexico. Also, parity for a few exports would come at the price of investment treaties, intellectual property and workers' rights agreements, environmental legislation, democracy, etc. A de facto extension of NAFTA is unlikely, given the opposition to the original NAFTA. Some US congressmen propose putting all regional exports on a par with Mexico's for three years while future trade relationships are negotiated.\n",

As Caribbean economies grow our ability to absorb US exports will also increase. There is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose for the Caribbean basin. Mr P J Patterson, Jamaicas prime minister, claimed that many jobs in the US depended on trade flows between that country and the Caribbean region.

Nobody is going to give us an even playing field, but we have to work to make it less uneven. There is yet no indication of what the US administration will propose for the Caribbean basin. The measures to be announced by the US are a result of discussions last year between President Bill Clinton and leaders from the Caribbean and Central America.

Although the British government insists that the incurable disease poses only a remote risk to human health, scientists are not sure what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. It has symptoms similar to scrapie, a disease long observed in sheep, eating holes in the brains of its victims and in its late stages causing an animal to stagger drunkenly. There are two human forms of spongiform encephalopathy: Creutzfeldt- Jakob disease and kuru.\n",

      "As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Great Britain in July, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. The Southwood report said it was most unlikely that the disease was a threat to humans. Mad cow disease has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britains cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the agriculture ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months. Irelands Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of BSE hysteria in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is remote. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep byproducts as a protein supplement. The Southwood report said it was most unlikely that the disease was a threat to humans. It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health, a consultative committee reported to the agriculture ministry. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder. The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. I think everyone agrees that the risks are low, says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. Irelands Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. I think it is a recognition not just of pressure from farmers but that the public would feel more confident that no BSEinfected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100 percent compensation, said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union. There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as CreutzfeldtJakob disease. The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans.

Clean-up from the spill continued as the oil slick was estimated to affect an area the size of Delaware. Alaska Governor Cowper said the coast Guard could better handle the clean-up than Exxon.

      "No people have been killed or even seriously injured by the spill, but oil has seriously disrupted the rich Prince William Sound fishing industry. Gorski said that the ease with which the refloat was accomplished may indicate that the damage, while severe, may not be as bad as earlier feared. The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been equaled, at least in this country, Rohl said. Together, those three charges have a maximum penalty of 27 months in prison and a 10,000 fine. Although Cowper said he did not want to be extremely critical of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental official said Exxon had been unresponsive. Portland, Ore., was the companys first choice, but it backed away from that option after Oregon Gov. Fired by Exxon After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on March 24, Hazelwood was found to be legally drunk and was fired by Exxon. Rep. George Miller DMartinez, a senior member of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee added during a tour of Prince William Sound that fraud is not too strong a word to describe Exxons cleanup claims. Also, animalrescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and hundreds of sea otters. President Bush earlier had sent a team of highlevel officials to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup was not necessary. The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. The 987foot ship lifted off the reef three hours earlier than the Exxon salvage crew predicted, proceeding without problem under close watch of a flotilla of six tugs and other support craft, including the Coast Guard Cutter Rush, to a cove on uninhabited Naked Island 25 miles to the southwest, where repairs will be made. He added that this technique also would produce a pressurized buffer of clean sea water between the oil left in the tanker about 15,000 to 20,000 barrels and the oncepristine waters off Valdez. Even as it made that concession, the company denied its ship would endanger any port it visited for repair. Almost 1 million barrels of oil were pumped from the Exxon Valdez to three smaller tankers over the last 11 days, and the salvage process began as soon as the last of the tankers left for Southern California refineries on Tuesday. Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr., commander of the Coast Guards 17th District in Juneau had no immediate reply to Cowpers request. The tanker refloat went unexpectedly well. Staff writer Larry B. Stammer in Valdez contributed to this report. Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with charges it was not handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon was the best organization to manage the effort. The ship was made airtight above the water line, and then, on Wednesday, compressed air was forced inside. However, flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. said. Naval architect Richard Smith, hired by Exxon, estimated before the refloat that the pressure would force enough water out of the hull to lift the ship at least three feet. Also, animalrescue teams estimate the spill has killed several thousand birds and hundreds of sea otters. We have a manmade destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.

This is the question the House of Representatives is scheduled to take up today when it votes on the Family Welfare Reform Act of 1987. The bills questionable premise is that larger expenditures on welfare will reduce welfare dependency. Together, spending for the seven major welfare programs those just mentioned plus the Women, Infants and Children program and the Low Income Energy Assistance program has actually increased since 1970 by 232 in constant dollars, to an annual total 65.7 billion. The bulk of the new money would go to higher AFDC payouts, extension of mandatory benefits to twoparent families and maintenance of certain benefits for welfare recipients earning some income. Nearly all AFDC families also receive Medicaid coverage, for instance more than threequarters receive food stamps, and onethird have children who receive free school meals. By further increasing rather than gradually reducing the level of benefits available to recipients, it makes welfare more, not less, enticing.

By the year 2040, people over age 65 will rise from their current 19% of total population to 37%.

      "Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age. Responses to these cost pressures vary from country to country. An alternative response to cost pressures would be further increases in borrowing to fund the welfare state. Most OECD countries have recognised the need to curb growth in these main areas of welfare spending during the 1980s, and have introduced policies to tackle the underlying causes. The most immediate impact of these demographic changes will be on pensions, where costs will in any case rise as pension schemes continue to mature. Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period. Some countries have succeeded in stabilising their welfare costs by measures such as these. In practice, increasing pensions in line with prices might be difficult to sustain if earnings rose faster. Tackling these longerterm pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services. But that would also have deleterious effects, according to the OECD. Tackling these longerterm pressures will require more than tinkering with charges and efficiency drives in welfare services.

Countries such as Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands have been extending their public healthcare systems to provide universal coverage. Many countries have also begun to tighten up on unemployment benefits, with reductions in benefit levels and more rigorous conditions to qualify. The impact of an ageing population on healthcare costs is less clearcut. Pensions typically account for about a quarter of the increase in public expenditure over this period. In both countries, ratios will peak at about 33 per cent in 2040. It says this is a situation which most would think unsustainable. Healthcare systems have been reformed to make them more efficient and to bear down on the cost of pharmaceuticals. But what most concerns those responsible for public finances is the strength of underlying pressures on welfare spending that will push costs upwards in the future. Moves are afoot in countries such as Germany and Italy to raise the pension age. The reasons for the growth include the greater ease of separation and divorce. Significant cuts in benefit levels, for example, may be needed including greater targeting of benefits on the most needy. The growth is accelerating, with the number projected to rise to more than 115m in 2000, 131m in 2010 and 156m by 2020.

Renault, French car manufacturer, which assembles cars in Slovenia, and Siemens, Germanbased mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has a joint venture with Iskra, Slovenias electronic and telecommunications manufacturer, have used Slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts of Yugoslavia, as well as to western Europe. Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenias exports were with the former Yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now defunct socialist trading block, and western European countries.

The U.S. Treasury wants the bank to bypass the governments of developing countries and invest directly in the private sector. Other bank managers want to see political strings attached to the World Bank's loans. The World Bank's goals of democracy and free markets are alien to some Third World countries. The bank's own research department believes that poverty must be relieved directly and thence education and health care improved.\n",

On average programmes have reduced balance of payments gaps, had a negligible impact on Gross National Product and led to falls in the ratio of investment to GNP. Some analysts, including US Treasury officials, believe lacklustre performance in much of the Third World reflects the inefficiency and sometimes corruption of governments.

It wanted to impose on developing countries policies that had become recently fashionable in the industrialised world. Direct parallels between the bank and the EBRD are dubious. The morale of staff is lousy, says Mr Charles Flickner, a senior analyst on the Senate Budget Committee and close observer of the bank. Such values are alien in many developing countries, but that does not imply they should be denied the means for economic development. Officials such as Mr David Mulford of the US Treasury say the recent forgiveness of about half of Polands official debt will not set a precedent for other debtors. He argues that the best way of stimulating growth and improving income distribution is to put resources into education and primary health care. What kind of bank will Mr Preston inherit from his predecessor, Mr Barber Conable? It is not an impressive bureaucracy, says Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics.

Many Third World countries have gone backwards. The biggest drag on growth is the huge debt accumulated in the 1970s and early 1980s. Mr Conable, a former Republican congressman, arrived at the bank in 1986 knowing little about either banking or development. There are alternative recipes for fostering faster Third World development. Most analysts, however, say the bank should tighten up a little. What kind of development legacy will Mr Preston inherit? Should a significant chunk of the banks loans be made direct to the private sector? The banks own research department is highlighting the need to relieve poverty directly and to improve fundamentals, such as education, nutrition and health care. In the long run it will be impossible to isolate Poland, he says. What we are trying to do is facilitate the flow of privatesector funds into sound investments.

Scientists said the area afforded the best opportunity to witness and study the eclipse because skies are usually clear this time of year. Solar eclipses occur when the moon positions itself between the Earth and the sun. Clouds obscured the solar spectacular in Jakarta, Indonesia, Hong Kong and in the eastern Mindanao city of Davao, where thousands of tourists and scientists had gathered to observe the eclipse. In Manila, thousands turned out under clear skies to see the partial eclipse that blocked about 75 percent of the suns surface at its height. This phenomenon is a clear reminder from God for mankind to repent its sins, said Theresa Teopengco, a government employee. Hymns were chanted and conch shells blown during the ceremony about 90 miles north of New Delhi. In Kurukshetra, India, an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after a public address system announced the start of the eclipse. Scientists said the eclipse would end at sunset in the Gulf of Alaska. Many other Filipinos marked the eclipse by going to church.

A recent media report indicates that 87 percent of gun owners themselves favor a seven-day waiting period for handguns; three quarters favor registration of semi-automatic weapons and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. The Second Amendment to the Constitution, however, continues to be the thorn in the side of any legal effort toward gun control.

In suggesting, for example, that it would be fine to ban automatic rifles but not semiautomatics, Kates is slicing the constitutional salami pretty thin. The fact that once upon a time everyone was a member of the militia doesnt prove that everyone still has a right to a gun even after the composition of the militia has changed. Of course the existence of an individual right to own guns doesnt mean that it is absolute. Around the world, national theologies are crumbling communism, apartheid and, here in America, the worship of guns to foreigners, the single craziest thing about us. But in what I suspect was the main purpose of his exercise establishing that a flat ban on handguns would be hard to justify under the Constitution Kates builds a distressingly good case. A Time MagazineCable News Network poll reports that 87 of gun owners themselves favor a sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases threequarters favor registration of semiautomatic weapons and handguns, and half favor registration of rifles and shotguns. Since the amendments stated purpose is arming state militias, they reason, it creates no individual right to own a gun. But liberals reject the notion that free speech is therefore limited to political topics, even broadly defined. This list seems quite reasonable and moderate, though where it all comes from is not clear. Of course the existence of an individual right to own guns doesnt mean that it is absolute. The downside of having a Bill of Rights is that the protection of individual rights usually entails social costs. Kates expends most energy demonstrating that at the time of the Bill of Rights, all ablebodied men were considered to be part of the militia and were expected to defend the state if necessary.

In suggesting, for example, that it would be fine to ban automatic rifles but not semiautomatics, Kates is slicing the constitutional salami pretty thin. Most right thinkers take comfort in that funny stuff about the militia. But would civillibertarians be so stinting about an amendment they felt more fond of? Talking and writing are as central to American democracy as they ever were shooting just isnt. If there is a good reply to Katess fusillade, the controllers havent made it. The most thorough parsing of the Second Amendment is a 1983 article in the Michigan Law Review by Don Kates, a gun enthusiast. Do you sense an outbreak of sanity about gun control? Working from that decision and the common law, Kates says the amendments protection should be limited to weapons in common use among lawabiding people, useful for law enforcement or personal defense, and lineally descended from weapons known to the Framers. This is as true of the Second Amendment as it is of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth. In the Supreme Courts one 20thCentury treatment of the Second Amendment, it held somewhat ambiguously in 1939 that sawedoff shotguns arent necessarily protected by the Constitution without proof that they are the kind of weapon a militia might have used.\n",

Elaborate plans have been made to evacuate danger areas, reroute traffic and close schools and businesses if experts feel a quake is imminent. Although most other countries have given up trying to predict quakes, Japan continues to spend 2.5 million dollars yearly to support this effort, which covers only a limited area. The source of the danger is the Suruga Trough, a deep off-shore trench which forms a boundary between two tectonic plates.
